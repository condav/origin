What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic 
merging vs. always doing merges manually?

automatic merging, if it works, is way way way 
way way way way faster than merging by hand. no 
dickery with code, just short commands and 
voila. however, git only does that if the 
changes are not made to any similar sections of 
code. git is also not smart enough to squish 
things together that are similar so it just 
tell you to figure it out. 

doing merges manually ensures that everything 
works properly (most of tyhe time) but is a lot 
more effort on your part, with shifting and 
editing and adding and removing manually. 
easier to let git do it, but may occasionally 
get you into trouble. this is why we have small 
git commits, and check the differences between 
the files before we merge them, right? 
right....?
