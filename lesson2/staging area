the staginbg are in an interim zone that allows to to easily control 
which files are commited in a single git commit. this allow you to group 
your minor changes to more than one file under a similar logical 
subsection, and makes it easy to double check which documents are being 
commited together. also, easy for command line stuff because you can add 
documents individually and then commit the group with a single command. 
may be tedious for larger groups of files, but commits should be 
logically small anyways, so it is inefficient to try and increase the 
amount of files you can add easily together in one commit
