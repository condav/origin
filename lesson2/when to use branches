What are some situations when branches would be 
helpful in keeping your history organized? How 
would branches help?

branches allow you to make experimental changes 
to an existing system without compromizing the 
original system, and allowing you (or others) 
to continue working on the original system 
while the changes to the experimental version 
are being worked out. these different branches 
can be then merged later on using the git merge 
function. 
also helpful to switch when there is a change 
of context of the work that is happening. main 
feature being the main branch, with additional 
changes and additions being different branches 
coming off the main system. or to help 
compartmentalize certain features, and allow 
different people to be working together on the 
same project, and basically have individual 
workspaces linked to the same larger project
