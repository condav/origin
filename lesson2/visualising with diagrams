How do the diagrams help you visualize the 
branch structure?

git status and git log dont really have a very 
pretty method of displaying changes in a 
meaningful way. while you can make simple easy 
changes in the therminal, and use colors to 
view code changes between commits, git assumes 
you have a general idea of how the system works 
and doesnt need to remind you how it all fits 
together every time you use it. plus, the 
terminal is not really the place for GUI fun 
times
diagrams give you an idea of how every section 
of branches and different commits link 
together, and how to use the varied git 
commands to jump between them conveniently, 
without confsion and loss of work
