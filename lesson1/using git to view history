GIT log will give you the timestamps and short notes on chnages to files 
within a certain directory. this directory has to be made into a GIT directory
using git init, which creates a .gitconfig file and .git folder. 
git.diff will compare two files given their commit codes. when setting
color in git.diff, remember it is written by americans, not canadians
