Version control allws you to make changes to your code without worrying as much
about creating new problems. if ever anything arises, so long as you limit
your commits to small logical leaps, it allows you to easily restore previous 
versions and pinpoint the changes that caused the problems. instead of just
saving one final copy, you have every iteration of it along the way
