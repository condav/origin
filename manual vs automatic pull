Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

if more than one person is working on different pieces of the same 
proeject at once, all through the same remote repository, it wont be 
helpful to have it all updated constantly. it would mess around with 
people's changes, run into the same problems of forcing awkward mixes of 
slightly different files that we talked about earlier when discussing 
git's non-remote lack of automatic updating, and finally you might not 
be finished with certain things, so any time based automatic updates 
would result in messed up files for other people, in partial states of 
completion. easier, cleaner to do it manually, with good inter-group 
communication.
