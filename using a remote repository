When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaboarting with other people, working from home on a larger project, or collaborating on work across vast distances or while travelling, using a remote repository for continued projects is awesome! it allows you to keep doing whatever it is you are doing, so long as you have a computer and an internet connection, from wherever, whenever, and however. the ULTIMATE FREEDOM IS NIGH. ALL HAIL THE GITHUB
